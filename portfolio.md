# My Projects

These are some of the publicly available project I have worked on and that I am proud of! This is not an exhaustive list as some projects are private. You can find more about these projects on my CV.

## Programming
### Beat Saber Everywhere ![Node.js](/assets/i/node.svg){:.logo} | [GitHub](https://github.com/Darkchaos2/DisAintThatGreatSaber)
In the never ending journey to quench my ever growing love for Beat Saber while not owning the equipment to do so, I attempt to satisfy these needs by producing ports to different platforms. After recreating this masterpiece of a game in the Nintendo Labo's garage, I found this was not enough. As part of a hack week Discord hosted in the summer of 2019, I found my chance to further fulfill my dreams by producing a playable version of Beat Saber inside of Discord.

### BeatSaber Scripting ![Node.js](/assets/i/node.svg){:.logo} ![Python](/assets/i/python.svg){:.logo} | [GitHub](https://github.com/Darkchaos2/BeatMap-drift)
I enjoy creating beat maps of songs for other to play on Beat Saber. To assist me with this, especially when using the NoodleExtensions plugin, I like to create scripts to assist in the map creation. This repository contains the base beat map, alongside the scripts used to generate the NoodleExtension note paths. As these beat maps are JSON based, the original scripts were created in JavaScript, however, I ended up porting them to Python just for fun. 

### Discord Bot for Role Automation ![Node.js](/assets/i/node.svg){:.logo} | [GitHub](https://github.com/Darkchaos2/Botty-Rewrite)
A Discord bot I created for the LSU Computer Society's Discord server. It allows members to assign themselves roles that allows then to get notification about the game role when people want to play. Also contains administrative features like a mass role wiper.

### Web-based Intractable Overlay for Streams ![HTML](/assets/i/html.png){:.logo} ![CSS](/assets/i/css.png){:.logo} ![JavaScript](/assets/i/js.png){:.logo} | [GitHub](https://github.com/Darkchaos2/LSUVGS-Smash-Overlay)
This streaming overlay is based of NodeCG, allowing for a webpage to be animated and changed without having to refresh that page. This webpage can then be used to show stream data, such as current players or scores, and for this data to be changed or modified seamlessly while still being live. Events are send from the admin panel which then trigger animations to hide the old information before injecting the new information and re-revealing it to the stream. It also auto-scales names, for those players who are fixated on using ridiculously long usernames.

### Custom Scene Collection Installer ![C#](/assets/i/csharp.svg){:.logo} | [GitHub](https://github.com/Darkchaos2/VGS-OBS-Scene-Collection-Installer)
This C# program compiles into a single executable which automates the installation of OBS scenes. This automatically opens the default location of OBS's installation directory, but also gives the user the option to change it, if their installation isn't the default. It then copies assets and pre-configured OBS scenes to this directory.

## Streaming | LSU Video Game Society
### Event-wide, weekend-long Streaming Infrastructure 
Infrastructure set up over a LAN hall which utilises NDI to locally stream to a computer which deals with the master stream to Twitch. These "micro-streams" can be turned on and off from anywhere during the event and will not affect the uptime of the master stream. Allows for persistence of stream but grants the flexibility of showing off every part of our LAN events.

### Immersive VR User Experience
Green screen set up with a virtual reality headset to be able to capture footage of members being inside of the games they play at our events.

### Intractable Tournament Stream Overlay
This web-based overlay can be imported as a browser source into your streaming software and is used to display the current state of the smash tournament data. It can be controlled from the admin panel and can seamlessly change information such as the current players, bracket and scores.

### Custom Scene Collection Installer
This executable makes it easy for members to use LSUVGS's assets and themes without having to reconfigure it on every installation. Users can simply run the installer and the pre-configured scenes will be injected into their OBS.

## Video Editing
### Society Trailer | LSU Video Game Society
Worked alongside the Media Officer to produce a new trailer for our society. I focused on the timings, transitions and audio syncing of the project.

### Personal Channel
I like to edit videos, whether that be to make people laugh with memes or to make something that looks cool like montages or showcases.

A good mix of the sort of things I edit is my channel trailer. This contains edits such as the use of motion tracking to inject objects into scenes, use of fluid camera movement and just funny moments I have recorded over my life.

One thing which I am proud of, which I originally didn't think I would be able to achieve, is the falling polaroid section at the end of my Spaltoon 2 look back video.
This tries to mimic the dropping pattern of falling polaroid photos with the use of bezier curves, ease in and ease out keyframes. Although not perfect, I am still quite proud of the outcome.
